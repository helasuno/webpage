## Helasuno Website
This repo houses the `mkdocs` materials used for the project's website.

### Building the Website
Once you have [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) installed, simply run the following:

    mkdocs build

A new `site/` directory will be built which will yield the project's website.
