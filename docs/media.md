Here, you can file a variety of videos that walk through:

- various parts of setting up an environment (ie. getting started);
- user tutorials for writing scripts;
- explorations of the interpreter's source code.

Each of these videos shows me using a Mac. Much of what is said here will translate to another *nix (like) environment such as Linux or a BSD. If, and where, something is specific to Windows, comments will be made about what adapations may be required.

## Getting Started
These videos walk you through how to get everything set up for your environment. It's highly recommended that you watch each of these videos in the order that they are provided.

### Packaging the Interpreter

## User Tutorials
These videos walk through how to write various scripts in the language with increasing complexity as you move further down the list. While you can certainly jump around in this section, it's best to start from the top and move towards the bottom, especially if you are new to script writing.

## Developer
These videos walk through the source code of the language itself. These are helpful if you're interested in knowing more about working on the language or modifying the source for your own needs.
