# Frequently Asked Questions
This document outlines some common (anticipated) questions.

!!! Note

    The language and documentation are under heavy development. Don't be surprised if you come across errors in the documentation, code, or both.

### What do I need to get started writing Helasuno scripts?
All you need to get started is a working install of Python (as of now, at least version 3.10) and the instructions in the [Getting Started](packaging_setup.md) document.

While you don't technically need Visual Studio Code, an extension is provided (see the [Getting Started](packaging_setup.md) document) that makes for a more pleasant coding experience. As of now, the Visual Studio Code extension supports syntax highlighting and snippets.


### Why do we need another scripting language?
We don't. In light of that, we might ask the question "why should I use this scripting language when there are an incalculable number that already exist, most (if not all) of which are better?" The answer is "you probably shouldn't use this as a serious language." The reason for this is quite simple and can be seen in the motivations behind this project:

1. To help me learn Python.
2. To help me learn about programming by making a language to code.

In light of the above, it's important to note that the language and the source code are also written to help others learn how to work with Python just as it is open for critique. I make no claims that the code is perfect or necessarily good so it's helpful to see that this project also has an implied third purpose:

3. To help others learn how to create their own rudimentary scripting language and engage critically with the code.

I make no claims, at all, that I have expertise in making scripting languages so this code is available for critique. I am more than happy for the code to be built upon, torn down, or used pedagogically to support a consideration of best or worst practices.
