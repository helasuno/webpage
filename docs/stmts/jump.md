The `jump` statement facilitates jumping around the script by line number. This is similar to the `goto` statement that you might see in other languages.

A note on jump statements needs to be made. Jumping in code via statements are controversial. As [Sanfoundry](https://www.sanfoundry.com/c-question-goto-statement-pros-cons/) puts it: "By using gotos excessively, you create a labyrinth of program flow. If you arenâ€™t familiar with gotos, keep it that way. If you are used to using them, try to train yourself not to." Or, put more humourously by XKCD:

I fully acknowledge that the inclusion of such a statement is not a good idea for moving around a script. It is hoped that this will be removed in the future with something better but for now, this is how you can move across a script.


### Structure

> [line number] jump [line_number]


### Statement Modifiers

None.


### Example
The following script will output *World* to the screen as line 30 would be jumped over.

    10 - The script is public domain
    20 jump 40
    30 writeln "Hello"
    40 writeln "World"
    50 end
